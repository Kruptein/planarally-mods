## What's included

It currently offers the ability to handle the character sheet of a wildsea ship. [^1]

It adds a context-menu entry to all shapes which allows you to add or remove a ship.
When added, a new tab will be visible in the shapes' properties dialog.

## Future

The plan is to add support for regular character sheets and also integrate with the dice system.
Though no particular timeline is currently available.

[^1]: The undercrew section of the ship sheet is currently still one big textarea.
